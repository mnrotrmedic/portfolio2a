                    My name is Matt Smiles. I live in Central MN where I have worked in the emergency medical transport
                    industry for more than ten years. I have always had a strong interest in technology, especially the
                    ability of technology to make life easier and to solve problems. I'm currently enrolled in a
                    Bootcamp to become a Full-Stack Developer. I think this is a great way to become a small part of the
                    tech industry and to help drive solutions, especially solutions for the Medical Transport industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a dad to three. In the summertime I like to do simple woodworking projects in my garage. In the
                    winter, I challenge myself with various tech related projects including moderately advanced
                    networking, home automation & other simple electronics projects. It's a privilege to be asked by
                    friends and family to help with their tech needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the current projects in my portfolio are assignments related to the Developer Bootcamp that
                    I am attending. As I finish the course, I look forward to the showcasing other projects that
                    demonstrate my abilities & passions.

                        #Goals is the first 'Full-Stack' app and was a group project. This app was deployed to
                        Heroku
                        (link above) and used Express JS, node, a MySQL database, Sequelize ORM and was styled using
                        Bulma, a CSS library. The team dynamic was great on this project but we learned early on
                        that
                        having too many hands in one Javascript file can lead to trouble. My primary role on this
                        prject
                        was writing the Express routes and related database calls using Sequelize.

                    <p>
                        Friend Finder is a 'Full-Stack' app that uses Node JS and Express JS. A user responds to
                        questions which then matches that user based on their similarity in score to other users. It's
                        pretty basic and the questions came directly from the assignment. It was great building an app
                        from the ground up that was deployable as a 'real' website though.

                </h4>
                <p>
                    The Train Scheduler app higlights the use of moment.js to make working with time data a bit
                    easier. It also uses Google Firebase as a modular back-end service to house the database
                    information. Firebase stores the 'train' information as it is entered while moment handles the
                    math for everything else on the page.
