                    My name is Matt Smiles. I live in Central MN where I have worked in the Emergency Medical Transport
                    industry for more than ten years. I have always had a strong interest in technology, especially the
                    ability of technology to make life easier and to solve problems. I'm currently enrolled in a
                    Bootcamp to become a Full-Stack Developer. I think this is a great way to become a small part of the
                    tech industry and to help drive solutions, especially solutions for the Medical Transport industry.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am a dad to three. In the summertime I like to do simple woodworking projects in my garage. In the
                    winter, I challenge myself with various tech related projects including moderately advanced
                    networking, home automation & other simple electronics projects. It's a privilege to be asked by
                    friends and family to help with their tech needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Many of the current projects in my portfolio are assignments related to the Developer Bootcamp that
                    I am attending. As I finish the course, I look forward to the showcasing other projects that
                    demonstrate my abilities & passions.
